Project Pitch: Web App for Interior Design Services

Project Overview: For my project I’ve decided to create a web application for my mom’s interior design services. My mom has always had a strong passion and talent for interior design. She recently has been telling me that she’d like me to make her a website so she can share her interior design expertise and make a business out of it. I want the website to reflect her style: clean lines, pleasing color schemes, and clearly organized.

Feature Specification: Clean lines, aesthetics, minimalist/neutral colors Clear organization with navigation bar section to showcase her work about section her history with interior design why she started her service a contact page if I have time, maybe some kind of interactive quiz to determine the user's service needs Type of home Apartment House Condo Single room Preferred style post-Modern Eclectic Minimal Maximal Art deco Etc. (include images here for visual aid) constraints Budget time Preferred colors Scene options Preferred materials Leather Linens Canvas Etc Desired mood of room Relaxed Exciting Comforting Calming feminine/masculine Fun/funky Inspiring etc.

Technical Specification: I have previously worked with react, javascript, and css, so I may use those again, or I may use a new language learned in this class. I will probably try Kotlin as I’ve read that it’s great for front-end and it would add a new language to my portfolio.
